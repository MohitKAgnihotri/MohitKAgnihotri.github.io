# Professional Projects Done:

## Philips Lighting Research, Eindhoven 
Employed in the capacity of senior embedded software responsible for developing ZigBee based solution
for various embedded platform. Working along the side of researchers, job also require regular ideation and pre-development to evaluate the
feasibility of the perceived solution/product.

## Ericsson, Sweden: 
Employed as a researcher, I was responsible to develop new
architecture for the short-range wireless solutions. My work with the
resulted in generation of 3 patents (under company internal review) and an
academic paper with title Topology Formation in mesh networks considering
Role Suitability.

## LTE Femto EnodeB Solution (Seoul, South Korea/Radisys): 
Acting as lead engineer, I was responsible for the development of user requirements and bug
fixes for the eNodeB solution. The development process included requirement
gathering, feasibility analysis, detailed development and testing for the
given feature. I was also responsible for the integration of eNodeB solution
on various hardware platforms like MINDSPEED, Broadcom, and Freescale etc.
Key technologies: LTE, C/C++, Python, SoC integration and RTOS.

## SS7 & Fault Tolerant Support (Bangalore, India/Radisys): 
I was the team lead and heading a team of 4 members which are actively supporting entire SS
protocol portfolio. My responsibility included guiding and analyzing
feasibility for all customer requirements. In addition, individual
responsibility included delivering upgrade and maintenance requirement for
TAPA DFTHA/FTHA solution. Key technologies: LTE, 3G, Reliability, C/C++ and Python.

## EGTP-C PSF (Bangalore, India/Radisys): 
This project provides fault tolerant capability to trillium eGTP-C layer. 
My responsibilities included providing the team with the technical leadership and mentoring. 
Additional responsibilities included involvement in the design, prototyping and
development of the product as internal owner and final testing of the
project on various platforms like Mindspeed, Broadcom, and NXP Soc.
Keywords: Key technologies LTE, 3G, Reliability, C/C++, Python and SoC Integration.

## Signaling Connection part (Shenzhen, China/Huawei): 
Worked as Senior Engineer on SCCP & SCCPx protocol development for the Huawei MSX, CSX, and
ASAU end Product. The key responsibilities in the project included
maintenance of the legacy protocol stack, optimizing performance with
product integration and developing new features as desired by the customer
to enter markets. Key technologies: SS7, TCP/IP, C/C++, RTOS.

## TCAP Development (Bangalore, India/Huawei): 
Played the role of system architect for the team involved in the development and maintenance of SS
components. Responsible for addressing the requirements of different
products and network elements like BSC, MSC, RNC and HLR and providing
timely and cost effective implementations. Relevant activities included
involvement in high-level requirement analysis, feature, and feasibility 
study. Key technologies: SS7, TCP/IP, C/C++, VxWorks.

# Academic Projects:

## Respiration rate monitoring: 
The project aimed to evaluate the video
algorithms for their suitability in monitoring respiration rate
unobtrusively. I worked in the capacity of research intern and prototyped
the video algorithms using C# and Python. The validation results allowed the
organization to affirm the feasibility of the approach and current practical
limitations when compared to clinical requirements. Key technologies: Image
Processing, Matlab, and C language.

## VLIW Processor on Silicon Hive: 
The project required to extend basic “Pearl”
soft-core developed in Silicon Hive SDK and adapt Viola–Jones algorithm on
soft IP cores. The project completed by extending the current design with
additional issue slot, hierarchical memory resulting in optimized execution
time by 38% comparing to the predecessor. Key technologies: VLIW
architecture, Silicon Hive SDK, and C language.

## Dynamic Memory optimization for Image Processing: The project aimed to
improve the cache performance and memory usage for the Linux implementation
of Corner-Harris algorithm. The final implementation achieved 58% reduction
in data memory and 23% improvement in execution time using C language. Key
technologies: Microprocessor Architecture, Image Processing, and C/C++.

## CNN acceleration on GPU: 
The project aimed to accelerate a sequential Linux
implementation of CNN algorithm for execution time. It was required to adapt
the algorithm for GPU allowing parallel processing. The team was able to
improve the execution time from 5 sec to 0.45 sec, resulting 11x performance
improvements. The CUDA and C were the key technology used. Key technologies:
CUDA, Image Processing, C/C++ and Python.

## Sequence support on SmartM3: 
Smart-M3 is a functional platform that provides
a cross-domain search extent for triple based information and it currently
supports single event programmability. The project aimed to extend the
platform to enable programming of a sequence of events. I worked as the
architecture and protocol designer in the project. The project was able to
extend the framework to allow programming simple sequences. Key technologies
Python, C and database.
